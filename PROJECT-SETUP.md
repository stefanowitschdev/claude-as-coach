# Claude-as-Coach: Project Setup Guide

## What This Is

**Claude-as-Coach** is an AI-assisted structured reflection system built on Claude Projects and custom skills. It provides a lightweight framework for daily summaries, weekly retrospectives, and weekly planning—helping you maintain context continuity across conversations, learn from experience systematically, and build sustainable goal-tracking habits.

**Problems it solves:**
- **Context fragmentation:** Each new Claude chat starts from scratch. This system maintains continuity through persistent documents.
- **Reflection friction:** Structured prompts reduce the activation energy for daily/weekly reflection.
- **Learning from experience:** The retrospective → planning loop helps you identify what works, run experiments, and adapt over time.

**Who it's for:** Anyone with goals requiring consistent reflection—learning new skills, health/fitness tracking, business projects, creative work, habit formation. If you've ever struggled to maintain a journal or reflection practice, this system provides the infrastructure to make it sustainable.

## The Core Loop

The system follows a daily → weekly reflection cycle:

### Daily Workflow

**Morning:** Say "good morning" or "gm"
- Loads yesterday's summary
- Generates a scannable morning brief (low cognitive load during wakeup)
- Sets context for the day ahead

**End of Day:** Say "daily summary"
- Guides you through structured reflection
- Generates `Summary-YYYY-MM-DD-DayName-tag.md`
- Captures key numbers, timeline, insights, decisions

### Weekly Workflow

**End of Week:** Say "weekly retro"
- Reflects on what worked and what didn't work
- Identifies experiments to run
- Tracks progress toward goals
- Generates `Weekly-Retro-YYYY-MM-DD-to-DD.md`

**Start of Week:** Say "weekly planning"
- Reviews constraints and capacity
- Sets 2-3 priorities maximum
- Defines success levels (L0-L3 framework)
- Generates `Weekly-Plan-YYYY-MM-DD-to-DD.md`

### Trigger Phrases Reference

| Skill | Trigger | Use Case |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Morning Routine | "good morning", "gm" | Start daily chat with context |
| Daily Summary | "daily summary" | End-of-day structured reflection |
| Weekly Retrospective | "weekly retro" | Reflect on the week |
| Weekly Planning | "weekly planning" | Plan the week ahead |

## Customization: Making It Yours

The base skills provide generic frameworks. You have two paths forward:

### Path 1: Start with Base Skills Only (Recommended)

**Use Rob as your template:** `examples/rob-the-runner/`

Rob demonstrates that **you don't need custom skills to get value**. He uses only the base skills and still gets:
- Structured daily summaries
- Weekly retrospectives
- Monthly rollups
- Fractal compression (recent detail → compressed history)
- Ongoing practice (Week 9 post-program exploration)

**This is the fastest path to getting started.** Import the base skills, start using them, see if they work for your goals. Only create custom skills if you need them later.

**Rob's profile:**
- 39-year-old accountant, couch-to-5K training + exploring yoga
- Uses base skills without modification
- See `examples/rob-the-runner/README.md` for details

### Path 2: Create Custom Skills (Advanced)

**Use Alice as your template:** `examples/alice-the-athlete/`

If base skills aren't enough, Alice shows how to extend them with custom personal skills:

- **Metrics:** Running distance, pace, heart rate zones, sleep quality
- **Context tags:** Week-Day format (W4-D2 = Week 4, Day 2 of training)
- **Protocols:** Recovery routines, pre-run warmups, fueling strategies
- **Success levels:** Calibrated to couch-to-5K milestones

You'll adapt this pattern to your domain.

### Step 2: What to Customize

**Timezone:**
- Base skills use `TZ='America/New_York'` for date verification
- Replace with your timezone (e.g., `TZ='Europe/London'`, `TZ='America/Los_Angeles'`)

**Key Numbers Table (Daily Summary):**
- Alice tracks: Distance, pace, heart rate, sleep hours, energy levels
- You might track:
  - **Learning:** Study hours, comprehension rating, topic mastery scores
  - **Business:** Revenue, customer calls, pipeline metrics, deep work hours
  - **Creative:** Word count, pieces completed, creative blocks encountered
  - **Productivity:** Deep work hours, tasks completed, focus quality ratings

**Context Tags:**
- Alice uses W4-D2 (training week + day)
- You might use:
  - Sprint numbers (S3-D2)
  - Phase labels (Bootstrap-D5, Build-D12)
  - Experiment IDs (ExpA-D3)
  - Or keep it simple: just dates

**Success Levels (Weekly Planning):**
- Alice's L0-L3 framework is calibrated to running milestones
- Calibrate yours to your goals:
  - **L0 (Minimum):** What absolutely must happen to call the week successful?
  - **L1 (Target):** What you're aiming for if things go well?
  - **L2 (Stretch):** What would exceed your expectations?
  - **L3 (Exceptional):** What would be a breakthrough week?

### Step 3: Create Your Personal Skills

**Directory structure (sister directories pattern):**
```
claude-as-coach-combined/             # Parent workspace
├── claude-as-coach/                  # Public repo
│   ├── /skills/                      # Base skills
│   │   ├── /daily-summary-base/      # Base skill source (tracked)

    └── /skills/                      # Your personal skill extensions
        ├── /daily-summary-personal/  # Source directory (tracked)
        │   └── SKILL.md              # Your metrics & context

        └── /daily-morning-routine-personal/
```

### Why Sibling Directories?

This project uses **independent sibling repositories** (sibling directories) rather than git submodules for the personal repo:

**Benefits:**
- **No cross-repo reference updates needed** - Commit to each repo independently
- **Simpler mental model** - Two independent git repos, not parent/child relationship
- **Each repo has its own history** - Personal repo isn't tied to public repo commits
- **No submodule complexity** - No `git submodule update` commands needed

**Exception:** The `vendor/skills/` directory IS a submodule because it tracks upstream Anthropic tools that update independently.

**In practice:**
- Make changes in `claude-as-coach/` → commit and push there
- Make changes in `claude-as-coach-personal/` → commit and push there
- No synchronization needed between the two

**Frontmatter format:**
```yaml
---
name: daily-summary-personal
extends: daily-summary-base
description: Personal extensions with my specific metrics
---
```

**Pack your skills** (from parent workspace):
```bash
cd claude-as-coach-combined

# Pack personal skill
python claude-as-coach/scripts/skill_workflow.py pack claude-as-coach-personal/skills/daily-summary-personal/

# Result: claude-as-coach-personal/skills/daily-summary-personal.zip
```

**Import to Claude.ai:**
- Upload both base + personal .zip files to your project
- Claude will merge them automatically during execution

**See [WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md](docs/WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md) for detailed skill editing workflows.**

### Customization Examples by Domain

**Learning a new skill (e.g., learning Spanish):**
- Metrics: Study minutes, vocabulary learned, conversation practice time
- Context: Topic focus (Grammar-W2, Conversation-W5)
- Success levels: L0 = Daily practice, L1 = Comprehension improving, L2 = Comfortable conversations

**Business/startup:**
- Metrics: Revenue, customer conversations, product iterations, deep work hours
- Context: Sprint cycles, product phases (Discovery, Build, Launch)
- Success levels: L0 = Core metrics tracked, L1 = Key milestones hit, L2 = User traction visible

**Creative work (e.g., writing a book):**
- Metrics: Word count, editing hours, scenes completed, creative flow state
- Context: Chapter milestones, draft phases (Draft1-Ch3, Revision-Ch1)
- Success levels: L0 = Daily writing habit maintained, L1 = Chapter completed, L2 = Breakthrough insights

**Health/fitness (beyond running):**
- Metrics: Strength gains, nutrition adherence, sleep quality, recovery markers
- Context: Training blocks, recovery weeks, testing weeks
- Success levels: L0 = Injury-free + consistency, L1 = Progressive overload, L2 = PR achieved

## Tips for Success

**Start simple:**
- Begin with just morning routine + daily summary for the first week
- Add weekly retro/planning once daily practice feels natural
- Don't force the full system on Day 1

**Skip when needed:**
- Miss a day? That's fine. The system adapts to you.
- Traveling or low capacity? Just do morning briefs, skip summaries.
- The goal is sustainable practice, not perfect adherence.

**Archive old content:**
- After a month, move older summaries to `claude-as-coach-personal/documents/archived/`
- Keeps your Claude Project context lean and fast
- Monthly rollups can compress weeks of summaries into one document
- See [WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md](docs/WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md#document-lifecycle--archival) for complete archival strategy

**Use observation → reaction pattern:**
- Base skills lead with observations from your data
- You react, confirm, or refine rather than generating from scratch
- Less friction than staring at a blank page

**Extended thinking helps:**
- For deeper weekly retros and planning, extended thinking mode provides better synthesis
- Morning briefs and daily summaries work fine with standard thinking

**Don't over-engineer:**
- The system is a **process framework**, not a prescription
- Adapt the structure to what actually helps you learn and reflect
- Remove sections that don't serve you, add ones that do

---

## File Naming Conventions

The system uses consistent file naming patterns:

**Daily Summaries:**
- Format: `Summary-YYYY-MM-DD-DayName-tag.md`
- Example: `Summary-2025-11-20-Wednesday-W4-D2.md`
- Tag is optional but recommended for context

**Weekly Retrospectives:**
- Format: `Weekly-Retro-YYYY-MM-DD-to-DD.md`
- Example: `Weekly-Retro-2025-11-17-to-23.md`

**Weekly Plans:**
- Format: `Weekly-Plan-YYYY-MM-DD-to-DD.md`
- Example: `Weekly-Plan-2025-11-24-to-30.md`

**Date = date OF events, not FOR next day.**
Your daily summary on Tuesday night captures Tuesday's events, not Wednesday's plans.

## Where to Run Commands: Two Workflows

### Workflow A: Parent Workspace (Recommended)

**Best for:** Managing both repos simultaneously, using Claude Code

```bash
cd claude-as-coach-combined  # Stay here for all commands

# Pack base skill
python claude-as-coach/scripts/skill_workflow.py pack claude-as-coach/skills/daily-summary-base/

# Pack personal skill
python claude-as-coach/scripts/skill_workflow.py pack claude-as-coach-personal/skills/daily-summary-personal/

# Git operations (change directory as needed)
cd claude-as-coach && git status && cd ..
cd claude-as-coach-personal && git status && cd ..
```

### Workflow B: Child Directory

**Best for:** Focused work on one repo at a time

```bash
cd claude-as-coach  # Work from public repo

# Pack base skill
python scripts/skill_workflow.py pack skills/daily-summary-base/

# Pack personal skill (reach into sibling)
cd ../claude-as-coach-personal
python ../claude-as-coach/scripts/skill_workflow.py pack skills/daily-summary-personal/
```

**Choose the workflow that fits your style.** The examples in this guide use Workflow A (parent workspace) for clarity.
