# Daily Summary Generator (Base Framework)

**Purpose:** Create end-of-day summary document for the specific date being summarized.

**Key principle:** Summary is OF a date, not FOR the next day. Filename matches the events it contains.

## Process

### 1. Verify Current Date

**CRITICAL FIRST STEP** - Prevents date confusion

```bash
TZ='Europe/Vienna' date '+%A, %B %d, %Y - %H:%M %Z'
```

Confirm actual date in user's timezone.

### 2. Determine Summary Date

Ask user: "Which date's summary are we generating?"

**Typical scenarios:**
- End of day, same chat: "Today" (the date just verified)
- Next morning: "Yesterday" (verified date - 1)
- Backfilling: User provides specific date

**Always confirm:** "Generating summary for [Day], [Full Date]. Correct?"

### 3. Ask for Context Tag

"What's the context tag for this day?"

User provides tag representing experimental state for that specific day.

### 4. Generate Filename

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Filename must follow template exactly**

**Format:**
```
Summary-YYYY-MM-DD-DayName-[context-tag].md
```

**Example:**
```
Summary-2025-11-15-Saturday-example-tag.md
```

**Rules:**
- Date in filename = date of events inside (NOT next day)
- Day name format: `Monday`, `Tuesday`, etc. (full name, capitalized)
- Context tag: User-provided, hyphen-separated
- Save to: `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`
- Common mistake: Wrong date, generic names

**Critical:** Date in filename = date of events inside.

### 5. Check Context Usage (Optional)

After tool calls, system shows token usage:
```
Token usage: 127200/190000; 62800 remaining
```

**Interpret:**
- <75%: Plenty of room
- 75-85%: Good time for summary
- 85-95%: Generate soon
- >95%: Generate immediately

Note to user if high: "Context at [X]% - generating summary now to capture full day."

### 6. Create Document Structure

**Formatting rules:**
- Use only standard markdown (headers, lists, bold, italic, code blocks, tables)
- NO HTML tags (`<details>`, `<summary>`, `<div>`)
- ASCII-safe characters only:
  - Use `->` not `→`
  - Use `"` not `""`
  - Use `-` not `—`
  - Avoid Unicode special characters

**Emoji usage guidelines:**

**Projects limitation:** Claude Projects file export mangles UTF-8 emojis into broken Unicode (e.g., `ðŸ"¬` instead of 🔬). Root Claude.ai has clean artifact view, but Projects does not (yet).

**Recommended pattern:**
- **Avoid emojis in data sections** (tables, timestamps, key metrics) - keep machine-readable
- **Use sparingly in narrative sections** if they add meaning
- **Consolidate at document end** for easy cleanup:
  ```markdown
  ✨🔬🧪💻🚀
  ```
  Single line after wrap-up = easy to find/remove if export mangles them

**Export preservation strategy:**
1. View summary in Projects web UI (clean UTF-8)
2. Copy-paste into local text editor (preserves emojis)
3. OR: Accept export breakage, manually clean up `ð` characters on local save
4. **Future:** Nanoagent will have proper UTF-8 file handling + custom UI

**When in doubt:** Use plain text. Emojis are decorative, not essential. Prefer clarity over style.

**Required sections:**

```markdown
# [Day], [Date] - Daily Summary

**GROUND TRUTH:**
- Date: [Full day and date being summarized]
- [Context state - cycle/phase/day info]
- [Long-running counters if applicable]

## TL;DR - Day Summary

[2-3 sentence summary of trajectory]
[Key decision or insight]
[How capacity showed up]

---

## Key Numbers

|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| [Data] | | | |

---

## Timeline

### Detailed Events

[Chronological events with timestamps]

---

## Insights & Learnings

### What This Day Revealed

[Major insights, patterns, experimental results]

---

## Decisions Made

### What Was Decided

[Decisions for future, protocol adjustments, changes]

---

## What Mattered This Day

[Clear summary of day's significance]
[No ambiguity]
```

### 7. Save to Outputs

```
/mnt/user-data/outputs/Summary-YYYY-MM-DD-DayName-context-tag.md
```

### 8. Remind User

"Summary created: Summary-2025-11-22-Saturday-[context-tag].md

This captures Saturday's events. Click 'add to project' to save it."

## Critical Rules

1. **Date verification FIRST** - bash command, no assumptions
2. **Summary date = events date** - filename matches content, NOT next day
3. **User confirms date** - "Generating summary for [Day]. Correct?"
4. **Filename follows format** - ISO date + day name + exact tag user provided
5. **Ground truth at top** - absolute date being summarized in document
6. **Save to outputs** - user manually adds to project

## How This Differs From "Carryover"

**Old approach (broken):**
- Filename: Carryover-2025-11-16-Sunday.md
- Contains: Saturday's events
- Result: Off-by-one error for weekly reviews

**Current approach (correct):**
- Filename: Summary-2025-11-15-Saturday.md
- Contains: Saturday's events
- Result: Weekly review searches Nov 10-16, gets correct events

The summary IS the daily record.
