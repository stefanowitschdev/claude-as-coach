- Trigger phrases added to skill descriptions (vendor best practice)

**Architecture validated:**
- All 4 core skills now use composable base + personal pattern
- Base frameworks shareable, personal extensions private
- Can refine base and personal skills independently

# Development Timeline & Architecture Evolution

*This section documents the design process, architectural decisions, and iterative improvements made during development. Preserved here as a portfolio artifact before git history squash.*

**Target:** December 12th, 2025 presentation
**Total development time:** ~2 weeks (Nov 25 - Dec 12)
**Development approach:** Iterative design with heavy use of Claude Code for rapid prototyping and refactoring

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Nov 25-26, 2025)

### Initial Architecture

**Goal:** Build infrastructure for managing Claude skills with git version control

**Key decisions:**
- Python-based skill workflow (pack/unpack .skill ZIP files)
- Git submodules for vendor code (anthropics/skills fork)
- Task tracking system (NEXT-SESSION.md, FEATURES.md, REFACTORS.md)

**Commits:**
- `e629087` - Repository initialization
- `6d451ad` - Submodules and Python workflow infrastructure
- `c1d953d` - Task tracking files established

**Outcome:** Functional skill editing workflow, ready for iteration

---

## Phase 2: Skill Separation Discovery (Nov 27-29, 2025)

### The Insight: Base + Personal Pattern

**Problem identified:** Monolithic skills mixed sharable frameworks with private health data
**Solution:** Separate into base skills (sharable) + personal extensions (private)

**Major changes:**
- `84f38da` - **feat:** Separate skills into base + personal architecture
- Created Alice example persona (couch-to-5K runner) as reference implementation
- Established `extends:` pattern in skill frontmatter

**F16: Directory Flattening Refactor**
- Simplified `personal/project_documents/` and `personal/reference/` → flat `personal/documents/`
- Matched Claude.ai Projects UI (flat file list)
- Personal skills organized into `personal/skills/` (parallel to main repo)
- `c877e5a` - Complete directory flattening refactor

**Design principle established:** "Shareable process frameworks separate from personal context"

---

## Phase 3: Source Tracking & Workflow Maturation (Nov 29-30, 2025)

### Making Skills Version-Controllable

**F18: Track Skill Source Code**

**Problem:** `.skill` files are ZIP archives - git diffs meaningless
**Solution:** Track source directories alongside .skill files

**Implementation:**
- `8d2694b` - Track skill source code in git alongside .skill files
- All skills now have `skills/NAME/SKILL.md` tracked in repo
- Edit skills in place (no unpacking needed)
- Pack workflow generates `.skill` files from tracked sources

**Workflow improvements:**
- Removed legacy `skills-working/` code paths
- Separated planning and retrospective into base + personal
- `dff272f` - Split retro/planning into base + personal skills

**Outcome:** Git diffs now show actual skill content changes, not binary ZIP deltas

---

## Phase 4: Composability Validation (Dec 1, 2025)

### Testing the Architecture

**F17 Task 1: Validate Base + Personal Skill Stacking**

**Critical unknown:** Does Claude.ai actually merge base + personal skills correctly?

**Testing approach:**
- Test Case B: morning-routine-base + morning-routine-personal in production
- Verified `extends:` directive recognized
- Confirmed skills merge without conflicts
- Validated content flows naturally between base and personal

**Key findings documented:**
- System requirements: Claude Pro (minimum), Max x5 (recommended)
- Model requirements: Sonnet 4.5 or Opus 4.5 (Haiku 4.5 insufficient)
- Extended thinking valuable for deeper retros/planning
- `a865d2d` - Document composable skill test results and system requirements

**New skills created:**
- `23002a2` - project-coach-setup-base skill (conversational project initialization)
- Added trigger phrases to weekly skills for reliable invocation
- `3d5c180` - Add trigger phrases to weekly skills descriptions

**Documentation created:**
- `c623402` - PROJECT-SETUP.md and Alice demo content
- QUICKSTART.md for fast onboarding

**Outcome:** Architecture validated in production - proceed with confidence

---

## Phase 5: Architecture Decision Point (Dec 1-2, 2025)

### Critical Question: How to Handle Personal Repo?

**Context:** Preparing for public release (Dec 12th presentation)

**The problem:** Need to separate public base skills from private personal data, but maintain good development workflow

### Decision Analysis (Dec 1)

**Created:** `DECISION-PERSONAL-REPO-PATTERN.md` (459 lines)

**Options evaluated:**
- **Pattern A: Submodule** - `personal/` as git submodule
  - Pros: Single clone, CLAUDE.md auto-loads, familiar pattern
  - Cons: Submodule reference updates, complexity for adopters

- **Pattern B: Sister Directories** - Independent sibling repos
  - Pros: No cross-repo references, simpler git workflow, each repo independent
  - Cons: Longer paths, manual setup, CLAUDE.md loading unknown

**Decision matrix:** 8 criteria evaluated (workflow simplicity, git complexity, etc.)

**Critical unknowns identified:**
1. Does CLAUDE.md auto-load from child when running from parent workspace? (MAKE OR BREAK)
2. Is path complexity acceptable for git simplicity benefit?
3. Where should users actually work day-to-day?

**F33: Sister Directories Pattern Validation** - Created to resolve unknowns

### Security Audit (Dec 1)

**Created:** `AUDIT-FINDINGS-2025-12-01.md`

**Scope:** Pre-public-release security review
- Scanned for personal health data in files
- Reviewed git history for sensitive information
- Documented findings and remediation plan

**Outcome:** Identified need for git history squash before sharing

### Implementation (Dec 1-2)

**Sibling directories pattern implemented:**
- `6b78443` - Remove personal/ submodule - use sister directories pattern
- `4d2d599` - Update documentation for sister directories pattern
- Created parent workspace CLAUDE.md example
- `65e5056` - Add F33: Sister Directories Pattern Validation

**Bridge approach (Dec 2):**
- **Problem:** Realized full F34 (parent workspace as public repo) was premature
- **Solution:** Bridge documentation supporting BOTH standalone and parent workspace
- `f7ab1e5` - docs: Add bridge documentation for standalone + parent workspace usage
- Removed "ALWAYS parent workspace" requirement
- Made parent workspace optional/advanced

**F34: Parent Workspace as Public Repo** - Deferred pending user feedback

**Outcome:** Repository works standalone OR with parent workspace - maximum flexibility

---

## Phase 6: Public Release Preparation (Dec 2, 2025)

### Cleanup & Simplification

**F32: Remove Git Operations from skill_workflow.py**
- `d7af33c` - Simplify skill_workflow.py: Remove git operations (F32)
- Users can use standard `git add` and `git commit`
- Core workflow: pack/unpack, not git automation
- YAGNI principle applied

**Documentation consolidation:**
- `988f682` - Clean up documentation for public release
- Deduplicated README/PROJECT-SETUP content
- Moved incomplete features to backlog
- Fixed path guidance to avoid cd/pwd confusion

**Requirements organization:**
- `5efcb81` - refactor: Move requirements.txt to scripts/ directory
- Better alignment with Python project conventions

### Merge to Main (Dec 2)

**Branch:** sibling_directories → main (fast-forward merge)

**Final state:**
- ✅ Works standalone (clone only `claude-as-coach`)
- ✅ Works with parent workspace (optional advanced pattern)
- ✅ Base + personal skill architecture validated
- ✅ Documentation supports both usage patterns
- ✅ Security audited, ready for F31 git squash

---

## Key Design Artifacts Created

These documents demonstrate architectural thinking and decision-making process:

1. **DECISION-PERSONAL-REPO-PATTERN.md** (459 lines)
   - Comprehensive analysis of submodule vs sister directories
   - Decision matrix with 8 evaluation criteria
   - Critical unknowns identified before implementation

2. **AUDIT-FINDINGS-2025-12-01.md**
   - Security review before public release
   - Personal data scanning and remediation

3. **FEATURE-sister-directories-pattern.md**
   - Implementation validation plan
   - Testing phases and go/no-go decision points

4. **FEATURE-parent-workspace-public-repo.md**
   - Future architecture options documented
   - Deferred with clear decision triggers

5. **docs/examples/parent-workspace-CLAUDE.md**
   - Parent workspace setup template
   - Preserved for users who want the pattern

---

## Design Principles Established

### 1. Separable Concerns
Base skills = shareable process frameworks
Personal skills = private metrics and context

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
Start simple (standalone) → advance to parent workspace when needed

### 3. User-Centered Scaling
- n=1 (author) - Use what works now
- n=10 (collaborators) - Streamline contribution workflow
- n=100 (adopters) - Minimize setup friction

### 4. Documentation-Driven Development
Major decisions captured in ADR-style documents before implementation

### 5. Reversible Decisions
- Git submodules → sister directories (implemented)
- Sister directories → parent workspace repo (deferred)
- Easy to undo if user feedback contradicts assumptions

---

## Technical Decisions Validated

### 1. Skill Composability
✅ `extends:` directive works in Claude.ai
✅ Base + personal skills merge cleanly
✅ Can refine each layer independently

### 2. Working Directory Flexibility
✅ Can work from child directory (standalone)
✅ Can work from parent workspace (advanced)
✅ Documentation supports both patterns

### 3. Git Workflow Simplification
✅ Sister directories = no submodule reference updates
✅ Each repo has independent history
✅ Simpler mental model for users

### 4. Vendor Integration
✅ anthropics/skills fork as submodule
✅ Automatic usage when available
✅ Fallback to manual ZIP if unavailable

---

## What This Timeline Demonstrates

**For potential colleagues/teams:**

1. **Iterative design thinking** - Willing to refactor when better patterns emerge (submodule → sister directories)

2. **Security-conscious development** - Proactive audit before public release

3. **Documentation-driven decisions** - 459-line decision analysis before major architectural change

4. **User-centered approach** - Explicit consideration of different user scales (n=1, n=10, n=100)

5. **Pragmatic engineering** - Bridge approach instead of premature full restructure (F34 deferred)

6. **Code quality focus** - YAGNI applied to remove unused git automation

7. **Portfolio-quality process** - This very changelog demonstrates thoughtful engineering practice
