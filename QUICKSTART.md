## For Claude

When a user pastes this document, help them set up the coaching system:

1. **Fetch each SKILL.md** from these URLs:
   - https://github.com/stefanowitschdev/claude-as-coach/raw/refs/heads/main/skills/daily-morning-routine-base/SKILL.md
   - https://github.com/stefanowitschdev/claude-as-coach/raw/refs/heads/main/skills/daily-summary-base/SKILL.md
   - https://github.com/stefanowitschdev/claude-as-coach/raw/refs/heads/main/skills/planning-base/SKILL.md
   - https://github.com/stefanowitschdev/claude-as-coach/raw/refs/heads/main/skills/retrospective-base/SKILL.md

2. **For each SKILL.md fetched:**
   - Use the `skill-creator` skill to package it into a .zip artifact
   - Present the artifact so user can download it

3. **Guide user to upload** all 4 skills via Settings > Capabilities > Skills

4. **Run the Project Setup flow** (inlined below) - no need to fetch this one

# Project Coach Setup (Inlined Skill)

**Use this now** to set up the user's coaching project. The other skills can be installed after.

## Workflow

1. Ask setup questions (one at a time, stop when user signals enough detail)
2. Generate Project-Goals.md artifact
3. Provide handoff instructions

## Setup Questions

Ask one question at a time. Stop when you have minimum viable info (primary focus + timezone).

**Essential questions:**
1. Main goal or focus for this coaching project (see conversation starter below)
2. Timezone for date verification (detect if possible, default America/New_York)

**Question 1 conversation starter** - lead with categories to help them explore:

> Let's figure out what you want to focus on. Most people use this for something in one of these areas:
>
> - **Health & Fitness** - running, exercise, weight, sleep, yoga, walking
> - **Habits & Lifestyle** - eating better, cooking, journaling, less screen time/doomscrolling, work-life balance
> - **Personal Growth** - learning something new, reading, meditation, getting organized
> - **Relationships** - more time with family/friends, travel
> - **Money & Career** - saving, budgeting, work performance
>
> Which area calls to you? Or if you already have something specific in mind, just tell me!

**If they pick a category**, help them get specific with examples:
- Health & Fitness -> "Cool! Are you thinking something like couch-to-5K, daily walks, better sleep, yoga...?"
- Habits & Lifestyle -> "Nice! Cooking more? Journaling? Cutting back on screen time or doomscrolling? Something else?"
- Personal Growth -> "Great! Learning a language, instrument, skill? Reading more? Meditation practice?"

**Optional questions** (ask if user wants more detail):
- Timeframe or milestone (8-week program, quarterly, ongoing)
- Key metrics to track (distance/pace, study hours, revenue, word count)

## Generate Project-Goals.md Artifact

Create artifact using this template (adapt to their responses):

```markdown
# Project Goals

## Primary Focus
[User's goal in their words]

## Target Outcome
[Specific outcome or "To be defined"]

## Timeframe
[Specified timeframe or "Ongoing"]

## Key Metrics
[Metrics mentioned or "Will define through use"]

## Timezone
[Confirmed timezone]

---

## Daily/Weekly Workflow

**Morning:** "good morning" or "gm" -> loads yesterday's summary, generates brief

**End of Day:** "daily summary" -> structured reflection (timeline, key numbers, insights)
- Saves as: `Summary-YYYY-MM-DD-DayName-tag.md`

**End of Week:** "weekly retro" -> reflect on what worked/didn't, identify experiments

**Start of Week:** "weekly planning" -> set 2-3 priorities, define success levels

**Tips:**
- Include timestamps when logging (richer timelines)
- Archive old summaries after weekly retro (lean context)
- Start simple: morning + daily summary first week

_Edit this document anytime to update your goals._
```

## Save Instructions

After generating, guide user to save the artifact:

**Web/Desktop:**
> Click the "Project Goals" tile (below response or in sidebar) -> click the dropdown near "Copy" -> select **"Add to Project"** -> confirms "File added to project"

**Mobile:**
> Tap the artifact -> tap "Download" -> go to project sidebar -> upload the file

## Handoff

```
Project-Goals.md is ready!

**To save it:**
- Web/Desktop: Click artifact -> dropdown near Copy -> "Save to Project"
- Mobile: Download it, then upload to project sidebar

**Then start using the system:**
1. Log activities in this chat today (include timestamps like "2pm - went for a walk")
2. End of day: say "daily summary"
3. Tomorrow morning: say "good morning" or "gm"

**Don't forget:** Install the other skills (links at top of this document) for full functionality!
```

## Troubleshooting

**Don't see Skills section?**
- Requires Claude Pro or Claude Max subscription
- Skills is a preview feature, may not be available in all regions

**Skill didn't trigger?**
- Make sure you're in a chat within a Project (not regular Claude chat)
- Check skill is enabled in Settings > Capabilities > Skills

**Skill-creator not working?**
- Make sure you have the skill-creator skill installed first
- Fall back to [QUICKSTART-MANUAL.md](QUICKSTART-MANUAL.md) for manual download

**Note:** Files shown as `.zip` in GitHub may appear as `.skill` in Claude.ai's UI - they're the same format.
