# Claude-as-Coach: Quick Setup with Pre-Built Skills

**Instructions:**

1. Download these 5 skill files (click to download directly):
   - [project-coach-setup-base.zip](https://github.com/ZachBeta/claude-as-coach/raw/refs/heads/main/skills/project-coach-setup-base.zip)
   - [daily-morning-routine-base.zip](https://github.com/ZachBeta/claude-as-coach/raw/refs/heads/main/skills/daily-morning-routine-base.zip)
   - [daily-summary-base.zip](https://github.com/ZachBeta/claude-as-coach/raw/refs/heads/main/skills/daily-summary-base.zip)
   - [weekly-planning-base.zip](https://github.com/ZachBeta/claude-as-coach/raw/refs/heads/main/skills/weekly-planning-base.zip)
   - [weekly-retrospective-base.zip](https://github.com/ZachBeta/claude-as-coach/raw/refs/heads/main/skills/weekly-retrospective-base.zip)

2. Upload them to Claude.ai:
   - Go to [Settings > Capabilities](https://claude.ai/settings/capabilities)
   - Scroll to **"Skills [Preview]"** section
   - Click **"Upload skill"** for each file
   - Confirm all 5 are enabled

3. Create a new project at [claude.ai/projects](https://claude.ai/projects)

4. Start a chat and say: **"set up my project"**

That's it! The skills will guide you through setup.

## What You Get

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| project-coach-setup | "set up my project" | Initial goal configuration |
| daily-morning-routine | "good morning", "gm" | Morning context loading |

## Troubleshooting

**Don't see Skills section?**
- Requires Claude Pro or Claude Max subscription
- Skills is a preview feature, may not be available in all regions

**Skill didn't trigger?**
- Make sure you're in a chat within a Project (not regular Claude chat)
- Check skill is enabled in Settings > Capabilities > Skills
- Try the explicit trigger phrase

**Note:** This approach uses pre-built .zip files for exact fidelity to the original skills. The files shown as `.zip` in GitHub may appear as `.skill` in Claude.ai's UI - they're the same format.
