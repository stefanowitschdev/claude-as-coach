# F19: Project Memories Evaluation

**Status:** Active - Evaluation in progress
**Effort:** Path A (1-2 hours for audit + decision)
**Priority:** Medium (clarity improves system understanding)
**Source:** Original backlog item + Week 8 retro (P4)
**Created:** 2025-12-14

## Problem

Unclear if the autogenerated memory summary (userMemories block) is providing enough valuable context to justify its presence. May be adding noise or outdated information.

## Goal

Evaluate whether Claude Projects' auto-generated memories provide value or add confusion.

---

## Evaluation Questions

### 1. Is the memory summary being actively used in conversations?

- Does Claude reference memories in responses?
- Are memories influencing output quality?

### 2. Is the information current and accurate?

- Export current memories, review for staleness
- Check for outdated context that may mislead

### 3. Does it help or hurt conversation quality?

- Test: Disable memories, run morning routine + daily summary
- Compare: Quality with vs without memories
- Measure: Date accuracy, format consistency, content relevance

### 4. What's the signal-to-noise ratio?

- Categorize memories by type and value

---

## Value Assessment Framework

| Category | Value | Risk |
|----------|-------|------|
| User preferences (timezone, tag format) | Medium | Low - consistent |
| Workflow patterns | Low | Medium - may conflict with skills |
| Domain knowledge | High | Low - additive context |
| Conversation style | Low | Low - not critical |

---

## Decision Tree

```
Do memories duplicate skills?
├─ Yes → Disable memory feature
└─ No → Do memories add unique value?
         ├─ Yes → Document what to keep/prune
         └─ No/Unclear → Do memories conflict with skills?
                         ├─ Yes → Remove conflicting memories
                         └─ No → Default to skills-only (simpler system)
```

## Tasks

- [ ] Export current project memories (screenshot or list)
- [ ] Categorize each memory by type and value
- [ ] Run comparison test (with/without memories)
- [ ] Make decision: keep, prune, or disable
- [ ] Document findings in WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md or this feature

---

## Possible Outcomes

1. **Keep memory system as-is** - Memories provide clear value
2. **Update memory content** - Prune stale, keep valuable
3. **Reduce memory scope** - Keep only essentials (timezone, preferences)
4. **Disable autogenerated memory** - Rely on project docs and skills only

---

## Not an Implementation Task

This is an **evaluation/decision task**, not a code change. The deliverable is a clear recommendation on memory usage (keep/prune/disable) with rationale.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Current memories exported and categorized
- [ ] Comparison test completed (with/without)
- [ ] Decision made and documented
- [ ] Either: memories pruned, OR feature disabled, OR documented as valuable
