# F29: Sally the Software Engineer Demo Persona

**Status:** Active - Demo content creation
**Effort:** TBD (estimated 2-3 hours for full persona)
**Priority:** High (Dec 12th presentation)
**Created:** 2025-12-01

## Goal

Create demonstration persona showing software engineering interview prep sprint (4 weeks) with daily→weekly fractal compression.

## Persona Background

**Name:** Sally the Software Engineer

**Starting Point:** Mid-level engineer (3-5 years experience), preparing for senior-level interviews

**Goal:** Land senior software engineer role at target companies through structured interview preparation

**Motivation:** TBD (career advancement? seeking better work culture? compensation increase? technical growth?)

**Key Challenges:**
- Balancing interview prep with current full-time job
- Covering broad topic areas (algorithms, system design, behavioral)
- Managing interview anxiety and building confidence
- Tracking progress across multiple study domains

## Deliverables

### Sample Documents

**Recent (Week 4 - Granular):**
- [ ] `Summary-2025-11-25-Monday-W4-D1.md` - Final week begins, mock interviews
- [ ] `Summary-2025-11-27-Wednesday-W4-D2.md` - System design practice
- [ ] `Summary-2025-11-29-Friday-W4-D3.md` - Behavioral prep, week complete

**Mid-range (Weeks 2-3 - Weekly Compression):**
- [ ] `Weekly-Retro-2025-11-11-to-17-W2.md` - Algorithm practice intensifies
- [ ] `Weekly-Retro-2025-11-18-to-24-W3.md` - System design focus

**Historical (Week 1 - Referenced in Retros):**
- No individual files, referenced as "ramp-up week" in retros
- Shows compression: initial setup week rolled up into narrative

### Personal Skills

- [ ] `daily-summary-sally-personal.skill` - Interview prep metrics and study tracking
- [ ] `daily-morning-routine-sally-personal.skill` - Review yesterday's learnings
- [ ] `retrospective-sally-personal.skill` - Topic mastery assessment
- [ ] `planning-sally-personal.skill` - Study plan for next week's focus

### Project Setup

- [ ] `Project-Goals.md` for Sally's coaching project
- [ ] Study protocol documents (daily study routine, mock interview prep, topic checklists)

## Data Scope

**Timeline:** 4 weeks (Nov 4 - Nov 29, 2025)
- Week 1: Foundations and assessment (identifying weak areas)
- Week 2: Algorithm practice (LeetCode, problem-solving patterns)
- Week 3: System design (architecture patterns, scalability)
- Week 4: Mock interviews and behavioral prep (final push)

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- **Study Hours:** Deep work hours per day/week
- **Problems Solved:** LeetCode count, difficulty levels (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- **Topics Covered:** Algorithm patterns, system design concepts
- **Mock Interviews:** Count, performance ratings, feedback notes
- **Confidence:** Self-assessment on 1-10 scale per topic area
- **Energy/Focus:** Pre-study and post-study mental state

**Context Tags:** W#-D# format (W4-D1 = Week 4, Day 1)

## Sample Data Structure

### Daily Summary Example (Week 4, Day 1)

```markdown
# Summary-2025-11-25-Monday-W4-D1

## Key Numbers
- Study hours: 3.5 (target 3-4)
- LeetCode problems: 2 Medium solved
- Mock interview: 1 (system design - 7/10 performance)
- Confidence: System design 7/10, Behavioral 8/10
- Focus quality: 8/10 pre-study, 6/10 post-study (mental fatigue)

## Timeline
- 6:00 AM: Morning review of yesterday's problems
- 7:00 AM: Work day (full-time job)
- 5:30 PM: Dinner break
- 6:30 PM: Mock system design interview (1 hour)
- 7:30 PM: LeetCode practice (2 Medium problems)
- 9:00 PM: Review solutions, take notes
- 9:30 PM: Prep behavioral responses for tomorrow

## What Worked
- Mock interview with peer went well - identified gaps in database sharding explanation
- Solved both LeetCode problems within time limit (improvement from last week)
- Morning review helped reinforce yesterday's learning

## What Didn't Work
- Mental fatigue after work + mock interview → slower problem-solving
- Tried to cover too many topics in one evening (should have focused just on system design)
- Skipped exercise (would have helped with energy)

## Insights
- Week 4 confidence building - patterns becoming second nature
- System design explanations improving with practice articulation
- Need to balance breadth vs depth - can't master everything in 4 weeks

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Focus on behavioral prep (STAR method examples)
- Review common follow-up questions from system design mock
- Take 30 min walk before study session (energy management)
```

### Weekly Retro Example (Week 2)

```markdown
# Weekly-Retro-2025-11-11-to-17-W2

## What Worked This Week
- Hit 5/5 study days (M-F consistency, weekends rest)
- LeetCode: 12 problems solved (8 Medium, 4 Hard) - up from 6 last week
- Identified pattern: sliding window, two-pointer techniques clicking
- Mock behavioral interview with friend (valuable feedback on storytelling)

## What Didn't Work This Week
- Wednesday exhaustion (worked late, tried to study anyway - unproductive)
- System design still feels shaky - too focused on algorithms this week
- Skipped review sessions 2 days (just rushed to solve new problems)
- Sleep average: 6.8 hours (down from 7.5 in Week 1 - unsustainable)

## Progress Toward Goal
- Halfway through prep sprint (Week 2 of 4)
- Algorithm confidence: 7/10 (up from 5/10)
- System design confidence: 4/10 (needs focus next week)
- Behavioral prep: 6/10 (drafted 5 STAR stories)
- Target: All areas 8+/10 by end of Week 4

## Experiments to Try Next Week
- Shift focus to system design (3 days SD, 2 days algorithms)
- Set strict 9:30 PM cutoff (protect sleep)
- Morning study slot on 2 days (test if fresher focus helps)
- Schedule 2 mock system design interviews

## Gratitude
- Peer network supporting with mock interviews
- Current job is stable (can focus energy on prep)
- Progress is visible - algorithm patterns sticking
```

## Success Criteria

**Demo persona complete when:**
- [ ] All sample documents created and realistic
- [ ] Personal skills created and tested
- [ ] Dates align with presentation timeline
- [ ] Data shows clear daily→weekly compression pattern
- [ ] Metrics demonstrate skill progression and confidence building
- [ ] Narrative is compelling for career-focused audience

**Presentation value:**
- Shows fractal compression in different domain (career vs fitness)
- Demonstrates knowledge work tracking (vs physical activity)
- Shorter timeframe (4 weeks vs 8 weeks) shows system flexibility
- Relatable for professional development audience

## Open Questions

**Q1: What specific motivation drives Sally?**
- Seeking better work culture (current job toxic)?
- Compensation increase (supporting family)?
- Technical growth (current role stagnant)?
- Geographic move (relocating to new city)?

**Q2: Should Sally's data include actual interview outcomes?**
- End of Week 4: offer received? ongoing process?
- Or keep it open-ended (demo focuses on prep, not outcome)?

**Q3: How technical should the content be?**
- Mention specific algorithms/patterns?
- Reference real companies (FAANG)?
- Include code snippets in summaries?

**Q4: Should we create companion EXAMPLES.md walkthrough?**
- Narrative version showing Sally's journey start-to-finish?
- Or just feature doc + raw sample files?

## Timeline

**THIS WEEKEND (Dec 7-8):**
- Create sample daily summaries (3 files)
- Create sample weekly retros (2 files)
- Create Project-Goals.md for Sally

**WEEK OF DEC 2-9:**
- Create personal skills for Sally
- Test skills in separate Claude Project (or same as Rob?)
- Refine narrative and metrics

**BEFORE DEC 12TH:**
- Validate all dates align
- Ensure data demonstrates fractal compression
- Practice demo walkthrough

## Notes

**Fractal compression demonstration:**
- Recent data (Week 4): 3 individual daily summaries showing final push
- Mid-range data (Weeks 2-3): 2 weekly retros compressing 14 days into 2 documents
- Historical data (Week 1): Referenced narratively in retros, no individual files

**Domain contrast with Rob:**
- Rob: Physical activity, health metrics, structured program
- Sally: Knowledge work, skill building, self-directed learning
- Both: Show goal tracking, reflection, adaptation

**Design principle:**
- Sally's journey should reflect real interview prep struggles
- Show imposter syndrome, energy management, prioritization tradeoffs
- Emphasize system's value: tracking progress when progress feels slow, managing breadth
