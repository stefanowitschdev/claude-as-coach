# Weekly Planning - Personal Extensions (Running Training Example)

**This skill extends `planning-base` with running training-specific context.**

**Note:** This is an EXAMPLE showing how to adapt the planning framework for couch-to-5K training. Replace with your own domain terminology.

## Personal Configuration

### Timezone
```bash
TZ='America/New_York' date '+%A, %B %d, %Y - %I:%M %p %Z'

# Show week being planned
for day in 17 18 19 20 21 22 23; do
  TZ='America/New_York' date -d "2025-11-$day" '+%A, November %d, 2025'
done
```

## Training-Specific Constraints

### Constraint Types to Identify
When asking about constraints (Section 2.5), use training-specific language:

**Training plan structure:**
- **Required rest days:** Non-negotiable recovery (plan says rest, you rest)
- **Long run day:** Usually weekend, different energy requirements
- **Specific workouts:** Speed work, tempo runs, easy runs (different demands)
- **Cross-training:** Scheduled alternative activities (cycling, swimming, strength)

**Schedule conflicts:**
- **Race day:** If race this week, everything builds toward that
- **Travel:** Can you run while traveling? Hotel gym? Safe running routes?
- **Work commitments:** Early meetings prevent morning runs? Late nights affect recovery?
- **Weather:** Extreme heat/cold/storms may require indoor alternatives or schedule changes

**Physical constraints:**
- **Injury/pain status:** Any niggles that limit training?
- **Fatigue level:** Still recovering from last week? Fresh and ready?
- **Soreness:** Still sore from hard workout? Need extra recovery?
- **Life stress:** High stress week may need lighter training load

### Example Constraint Questions
- "What does the training plan call for this week? (Required rest days, long run day, specific workouts?)"
- "Any races, travel, or schedule conflicts that affect when you can run?"
- "How's your body feeling? Any injuries, persistent soreness, or fatigue carrying over from last week?"
- "What's your stress/sleep situation? Should we adjust training load accordingly?"

## Success Levels - Training Context

### Level 0: Foundation (Context-Dependent)

**In base building:**
- Showed up for scheduled runs
- Maintained consistency (didn't skip rest days OR run days)
- Stayed injury-free
- Listened to body (rested if needed, ran if felt good)

**In build phase:**
- Completed key workouts (long run, quality sessions)
- Maintained easy day discipline (didn't run hard on easy days)
- Managed fatigue (no injuries, appropriate recovery)
- Progressing through plan safely

**During taper:**
- Followed taper plan (resisted urge to do extra)
- Maintained fitness without fatigue
- Stayed healthy (no injuries or illness)
- Mentally prepared for race

**Comeback/recovery from injury:**
- Followed return-to-running plan
- Pain-free running (or managed within limits)
- Didn't rush progression
- Built back sustainably

**Key principle:** Level 0 definition shifts with training phase. What counts as "foundation" in base building is different from build phase.

### Calibrating Other Levels

**Level 1-3 calibration:**
- Relative to current training phase (from retro assessment)
- Account for schedule constraints
- Realistic given injury status/fatigue level
- Progressive but sustainable

**Example calibration (Base Building, Week 4):**
- Level 0: Completed 3 run days (per plan), stayed injury-free
- Level 1: Completed all 3 runs, increased continuous running time as planned
- Level 2: Completed all runs, felt strong, good recovery, ready for week 5
- Level 3: All runs + extra strength work + great energy + progressing ahead of plan

**Example calibration (Build Phase, Week 8):**
- Level 0: Hit key workouts (long run + one quality session), managed fatigue
- Level 1: Completed full training week as prescribed, appropriate effort levels
- Level 2: All runs + pace targets met + good recovery + no injuries
- Level 3: Great week + PR in workout + felt strong + confidence building

**Example calibration (Taper Week):**
- Level 0: Followed taper plan, stayed healthy, no injuries
- Level 1: Taper executed well, feeling fresh, legs bouncing back
- Level 2: Perfect taper, race-ready, mentally prepared, logistics sorted
- Level 3: Optimal taper + confidence high + ready for PR attempt

## Priority Setting - Training Context

### Constraint-Aware Priority Examples

**Given training plan constraint:**
- "Plan calls for long run Sunday → make that Priority 1, schedule weekend accordingly"
- "Rest day Tuesday → plan other life tasks then, don't try to cram running in"
- "Speed workout Wednesday → ensure good sleep Tues night, lighter schedule Wed"

**Given race day constraint:**
- "Race Saturday → taper through week, logistics prep, mental readiness"
- "5K Sunday → easy runs early week, rest Fri-Sat, race-day planning"

**Given injury/fatigue constraint:**
- "Knee still sore → modify training plan, prioritize PT exercises, skip speed work"
- "Tired from last week's hard block → lighter week, focus on recovery, easy miles only"
- "Achilles niggle → cross-training instead of running, evaluate before progressing"

**Given schedule constraint:**
- "Travel Mon-Wed → plan rest days then, stack runs Thurs-Sun"
- "Early meetings this week → evening runs instead of morning, adjust accordingly"
- "Hot weather predicted → morning runs only, hydration emphasis, adjust pace"

### Priority Reordering Based on Training

**Training-first ordering:**
1. Injury prevention/recovery (PT, rest days, listen to body)
2. Key workouts per training plan (long run, quality sessions)
3. Easy runs and cross-training (fill in around #1-2)

**Strategic planning ordering:**
1. Non-negotiable: Required rest days (recovery is training too!)
2. High priority: Long run or key quality workout
3. Medium priority: Easy runs, cross-training
4. Stretch: Extra strength work, mobility, optional activities

## Experiment Selection - Training Context

### Types of Experiments

**Pacing experiments:**
- Try running by effort instead of pace (heart rate zones)
- Test negative split strategy (start slower, finish faster)
- Experiment with run/walk ratios (more walk = sustainable?)
- Try conversational pace for all easy runs (talking test)

**Fueling experiments:**
- Pre-run meal timing (1 hour before? 2 hours? Fasted?)
- During-run fuel for long runs (gels, chews, real food, timing)
- Post-run recovery nutrition (protein timing, hydration)
- Race day fueling plan (test in training, never try new on race day)

**Training plan experiments:**
- Add extra rest day if recovery struggling
- Substitute cross-training for easy run day
- Adjust long run pace (slower = more sustainable?)
- Modify speed workout (fewer reps, longer recovery)

**Recovery experiments:**
- Post-run routine changes (stretching, foam rolling, ice bath)
- Sleep optimization (earlier bedtime, sleep tracking)
- Active recovery strategies (easy bike, swimming, yoga)
- Strength work integration (when, how much, which exercises)

**Form experiments:**
- Cadence adjustments (run tracker analysis, metronome training)
- Foot strike changes (midfoot vs heel, gradual transition)
- Running posture improvements (lean from ankles, relaxed shoulders)
- Breathing patterns (rhythmic breathing, nasal breathing on easy runs)

**Gear experiments:**
- New running shoes (rotate in gradually)
- Clothing for different weather (moisture-wicking, layers)
- Running watch/tracker features (HR zones, pace guidance)
- Accessories (hydration vest for long runs, headphones, etc.)

### Experiment Safety

**Staging experiments:**
- One variable at a time (if testing new shoes, don't also try new pace)
- Test on easy runs first (not long runs or hard workouts)
- Have fallback plan (carry phone, know bail-out routes)
- Monitor carefully (pain? Unusual fatigue? Stop if concerning)

**Deferring experiments:**
- Race week → stick with known-good strategies
- Injury present → focus on recovery, not progression
- High life stress → maintain routine, don't add variables
- Already pushing volume/intensity → consolidate gains before testing

## Integration Notes

**This personal skill provides running/fitness training domain context.**

**The base skill provides:**
- Complete planning process structure
- Constraint identification framework
- Conversation patterns
- Priority setting methods
- Success level structure
- Core principles

**Together they create a complete running training-focused weekly planning system.**

**Adapt this example:** Replace running terminology with YOUR domain (learning, business, creative work, etc.)
