# Weekly Retrospective - Personal Extensions (Running Training Example)

**This skill extends `retrospective-base` with running training-specific context.**

**Note:** This is an EXAMPLE showing how to adapt the retrospective framework for couch-to-5K training. Replace with your own domain terminology.

## Personal Configuration

### Timezone
```bash
TZ='America/New_York' date '+%A, %B %d, %Y - %I:%M %p %Z'

# Show week being reviewed (includes previous Sunday)
for day in 9 10 11 12 13 14 15; do
  TZ='America/New_York' date -d "2025-11-$day" '+%A, November %d, 2025'
done
```

## Domain-Specific Terminology

### Context Line
**Training Context:** Brief context about training phase or race schedule (e.g., "Week 4 of couch-to-5K, building endurance")

### Training States
When describing capacity/progress trends, use these training-specific modes:
- **Base building:** Establishing aerobic foundation, focus on consistency and time on feet
- **Build phase:** Increasing volume/intensity, testing boundaries carefully
- **Taper/recovery:** Reducing load before race or after hard block
- **Maintenance:** Holding current fitness level, not actively building
- **Comeback/rebuild:** Building back after injury or break

### Running-Specific Patterns
When identifying patterns in "What Worked" or "What Didn't Work":
- Training execution (completed runs, hit paces, followed plan)
- Pace/distance/time progressions
- Heart rate zone distribution (too much Z3/Z4, good Z2 base)
- Running form and efficiency
- Fueling and hydration strategies
- Recovery quality (sleep, soreness, freshness)
- Injury prevention (stretching, strength work, rest days)

### Experiment Types
Common experiments in running context:
- Pacing strategies (testing different effort levels, negative splits)
- Fueling trials (pre-run meals, during-run nutrition, hydration)
- Training plan modifications (run/walk ratios, frequency, volume)
- Recovery strategies (ice baths, foam rolling, active recovery runs)
- Gear testing (shoes, clothing, accessories)
- Form adjustments (cadence, foot strike, posture)

## Progress Tracking Context

### Capacity Comparisons
When comparing across timeframes, attend to:
- Endurance progress (how long can you run continuously?)
- Pace improvements (same effort, faster pace OR same pace, easier effort)
- Recovery speed (soreness duration, readiness for next run)
- Injury status (pain-free, managing niggles, sidelined)
- Consistency (adherence to plan, runs completed vs skipped)

### Trajectory Language
Use training-specific trajectory descriptions:
- "Building aerobic base" vs "Losing fitness"
- "Pace improving" vs "Pace stagnating/declining"
- "Staying injury-free" vs "Dealing with injuries"
- "Consistent training" vs "Spotty adherence"
- "Progressing through plan" vs "Stuck at current level"

## Section-Specific Guidance

### What Worked (Training Context)
Celebrate wins specific to running:
- Runs completed (especially tough ones!)
- Pace/distance/time PRs or milestones
- Good execution of training plan
- Solid recovery practices
- Staying injury-free
- Enjoyment and motivation sustained
- New gear that worked well

### What Didn't Work (Training Context)
Challenges specific to running:
- Missed runs or inconsistent training
- Pace/endurance not progressing as hoped
- Pain, injury, or persistent soreness
- Poor recovery (tired, overtrained)
- Motivation challenges
- Gear problems
- Fueling/hydration issues

Pair with running-appropriate experiments:
- Training plan adjustments (volume, intensity, frequency)
- Form corrections (drills, video analysis, coaching)
- Recovery enhancements (more rest, better sleep, nutrition)
- Injury management (rest, PT, cross-training)
- Motivation strategies (running buddy, new routes, race signup)

### Gratitude (Training Context)
Even in difficult training weeks, appreciate:
- Body's ability to run (not everyone can)
- Progress made, no matter how small
- Lessons learned from challenging runs
- Community support (running groups, online forums)
- Outdoor time and fresh air
- Mental health benefits of running
- Showing up and trying, even when hard

## Integration Notes

**This personal skill provides running/fitness domain language and examples.**

**The base skill provides:**
- Complete process structure
- Conversation patterns
- Section templates
- Core principles
- Edge case handling

**Together they create a complete running training-focused weekly retrospective.**

**Adapt this example:** Replace running terminology with YOUR domain (learning, business, creative work, etc.)
